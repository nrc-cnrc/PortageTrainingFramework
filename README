                  PORTAGEshared experimental framework

Framework author: Samuel Larkin, with suggestions by George Foster and Eric
Joanis


This experimental framework is intended as a starting point for experiments
with PORTAGEshared.  It uses recommended settings for a reasonable baseline
experiment.  In practice, our baseline settings change all the time, at NRC, as
we continue our research on Statistical Machine Translation, so no framework
can truly represent the current state of the art.  Nonetheless, we've tried to
present in this framework our currently recommended practice.
